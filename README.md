We developed a passive method to study IP anycast by utilizing BGP data.
We proposed a set of BGP-related features to classify anycast/unicast prefixes by using the BGP data (RouteViews and RIPE RIS) and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by using the active measurement results as a near-ground-truth. The results show that 
our approach achieves high classification accuracy, about 90\% for anycast and 99\% for unicast. 

While further delving into the causes of inaccuracy, we found that remote peering has an unintended impact on anycast routing, due to its invisibility at layer-3, breaking the assumption that the peered autonomous systems are physically close and provide a short path. In our study, 19.2\% of anycast prefixes are sensitive to remote peering and around 40\% of such prefixes are further confirmed to be impacted by remote peering via traceroute measurements.

Due to limit of size, we didn't include large files like BGP data, which can be downloaded from RouteView/RIPE NCC, or retrieved from CAIDA's [BGPStream](https://bgpstream.caida.org/). If you need those files to reproduce your results, we have included the method in our paper and feel free to contact us by email (bianrui@udel.edu).
