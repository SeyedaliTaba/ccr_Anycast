We check the remote peering IP in IP path of RIPE atlas experiments and check if remote peering IP in more than 2 IXP. We find all remote peering IP belong to one IXP. I also manually check the IXP which the path traverse in RIPE atlas websites and check if the IXP is matching the IXP which remote peering IP belong to. I check that most are matched but I don't leave the results.
