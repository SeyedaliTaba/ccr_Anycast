Due to limit of size, we didn't include large files like BGP data, which can be downloaded from RouteView/RIPE NCC, or retrieved from CAIDA's BGPStream. If you need those files to reproduce your results, we have included the method in our paper and feel free to contact us by email (bianrui@udel.edu).
