Descriptions

construct_datasets.py: construct datasets for classification
decision_tree_save_results.py: classification using decision tree algorithm
extract_asrelation_distance.py: process raw BGP file, get the distance of AS
process_anycast_to_get_complete_data.py: process BGP data get BGP features
process_data_mulway_ris.py: Process raw BGP data, get origin AS and upstream AS, and list the distance of upstream AS for each prefix
process_unicast_to_get_complete_data.py: # process unicast prefix BGP data get BGP features
randomforest_save_results: classification using random forest algorithm

Due to limit of size, we didn't include large files like BGP data, which can be downloaded from RouteView/RIPE NCC, or retrieved from CAIDA's BGPStream. If you need those files to reproduce your results, we have included the method in our paper and feel free to contact us by email (bianrui@udel.edu).
